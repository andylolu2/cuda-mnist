## But why?

I wanted to know how much overhead is added by Python-based ML frameworks like PyTorch, and how much faster we can possibly get by going lower-level (CUDA). It is also a good exercise for me to learn CUDA.

I also wrote a blog post on **How Matrix Multiplication Works on the GPU**, you can read it on [here on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@andylo/matrix-multiplication-on-gpu) or [here on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/matrix-multiplication-on-the-gpu-e920e50207a8?source=friends_link&sk=020a915e1fce7d910aacda22bce89129).

## So... how slow is PyTorch?

It's... pretty slow, at least for small networks. Even using PyTorch 2.0's `torch.compile` functionality (with `mode="max-autotune"` and `fullgraph=True`, which is supposed to remove all Python overhead), it can still be up to $6$ times slower than CUDA!

This overhead goes down as the network gets larger, though it never completely goes away. It asymptotically approaches $\approx 20\%$ times slower than CUDA.

There are a few reasons why PyTorch is (asymptotically) slower than CUDA:
1. The main contributor is my implementation usees fp16 accumulation for matrix multiplication while PyTorch uses fp32. NVIDIA reports double(!) the amount of theoretical throughput using fp16. PyTorch defaults to fp32 for stability reasons, but I haven't encountered those issues in my runs.
2. I tuned the hyperparameters for the CUDA implementation specifically for my hardware. I'm not sure if `max-autotune` does the same for PyTorch.

> 2. I allowed the PyTorch implementation to have a few warm-up steps before timing, to allow the JIT compiler to compile the graph.

## Loss curve sanity check

Comparing the loss curves of the PyTorch and CUDA implementations, we can see that they are pretty much identical.
